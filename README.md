* export_kindle_highlight.py

This script exports all highlights from Kindle into `txt` files, one for each book with highlights. For it to work, you must copy your "My Clippings.txt" file from your Kindle to directory containing this Python script. For ir, you will want to connect your Kindle to your computer via USB, and "My Clippings.txt" can usually be found under the `documents` directory. To execute it, run `python export_kindle_highlight.py`. You will find a "books" directory containing your highlights.
